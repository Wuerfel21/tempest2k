- Fix framebuffer glitch on game over screen on some boards
- Rethink default controls (?)
- Is the crosshair off-center in the Jaguar version, too?
- Make it harder to skip end screen on accident
- Fix 1-frame glitch on warp stage complete
- Revist music assignments
- Code cleanup (I think it's still including stub files for some things?)
- Fix remaining MOD issues (only affects tune6.mod ??? (soundtest 12 !))
  - Wait, I think it's actually fine, I'm just stupid
  - let's just put it in the 8th music slot where no one will notice
