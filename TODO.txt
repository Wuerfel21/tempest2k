later:
- Rethink default controls (?)

- Fix 1-frame glitch on warp stage complete
- Optimize ripplewarp/texter/prettypoly so menu screens all run fast on EVAL96MB
  - Check performance on 4 bit bus! DONESKI (is ok)
    - Figure out what actual good values for burst length are?
- P2 minor adjustments (animation timers, button text, etc) PARTIAL
  - beastly mode related texts need editing
- Revist music assignments
- Code cleanup (I think it's still including stub files for some things?)
- Fix remaining MOD issues (only affects tune6.mod ??? (soundtest 12 !))
  - Wait, I think it's actually fine, I'm just stupid
  - let's just put it in the 8th music slot where no one will notice
