Here is the Imagitec Jaguar music player with all 13 Tempest tunes and the sound effects.

The tunes and sound effects load into ROM.  The player code and data loads into RAM.

In rdbjag, type :

load l.db
loadmods
load l1.db
loadsams
load a.db
y

This will make the first 12 tunes accessible via the keypad and the first 12 sound FX
also accessible via keypad. OPTION toggles music<->SFX selection.

Replacing l1 with l2 in the above sequence will make the remaining SFX available.
You will have to edit l.db to replace another tune with tune13.mod if you want to hear it.

As always, call if you have problems.
